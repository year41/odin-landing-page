Reflection

It has been about 2 weeks coding this landing page, it kind of looks ok on my screen but when changing the window size everything shift unpredictable, I understand better how to use the flexbox but now I'm confused about the box model. There are many thing to correct here but as I keep learning I hope I'll come back to update the page using better the flexbox resources.
